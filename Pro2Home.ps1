#Script that manipulates the registry to downgrade windows 10 pro to windows 10 home
#Really useful when imaging devices with pro to devices with home, as swapping product keys often doesn't work
#After you run this, run an upgrade install via a windows image matching your version of windows, and voila!
#This script was created 17/5/19, I can't guarentee it will work in the future, this is just how windows works right now

#Written by Michael Condon, I learned how to do this from Simon Calabrese
