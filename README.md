# PS-Scripts
A collection of PowerShell scripts that I'm creating while learning Powershell Syntax

System Info:
Just lists a bunch of system specs, this was just me playing arond with WMIC for the first time

Update-Fix:
A script I use to clear out the windows SoftwareDistribution folder. This can help resolve particularly stubborn Windows update issues by
removing the already downloaded update files.
