# PS-Scripts
A collection of PowerShell scripts that I'm creating while learning Powershell Syntax

System Info:
Just lists a bunch of system specs, this was just me playing arond with WMIC for the first time

Update-Fix:
A script I use to clear out the windows SoftwareDistribution folder. This can help resolve particularly stubborn Windows update issues by
removing the already downloaded update files.

HIBP:
A script that uses the Have I Been Pwned API made available by Troy Hunt (https://github.com/TroyHunt) to check if the email you've entered has been found in a data breach dump. Right now it just checks for data breaches using the API.
